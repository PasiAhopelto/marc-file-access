This package provides UNIMARC data model the library.  UNIMARC records are
modelled as <code>Record</code>s that contain <code>Field</code>s.  The
concrete values of the fields are in <code>SubField</code>s contained by the
<code>Field</code>s.  
<p>

The following example illustrates the classes's relation to UNIMARC format:

<pre>
001.__ 0710602383
010.__ |a 0-7106-0238-3
       |b sid.
</pre>

Corresponding <code>Record</code> would contain two <code>Field</code>s with
identifiers 001 and 010.  Field 001 would contain single identifierless
<code>SubField</code> with value 0710602383.  Field 010 would contain two
<code>SubField</code>s with identifiers a and b, and values "0-7106-0238-3" and
"sid." respectively.  In both fields indicators (shown as underscores above)
would be undefined.
